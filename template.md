# Casey Hoepner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Before coming to Turing I had almost no programming skills. During Mod 1 I set out to learn the foundational skills and knowledge required to start working towards a complete career shift into Software Development. One of the main reasons I chose to study at Turing as opposed to online was for community. I desired to be around others who were working toward similar goals as me. I wanted to be able to ask questions as they come up and aid others in their learning as well.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Static Comp 1

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-1
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

We weren't too deep into the module yet, so I took this static comp as an opportunity to experiment with design. My biggest win was adding photos to the individual boxes on hover. This project also gave me an opportunity to learn CSS grid -- which I hadn't used before. 

Evaluation comments: Nice job adding opacity to the hover photos so that the overlayed text remains easy to read, but perhaps make it a bit more opaque next time. Don't forget your meta tag!

#### Static Comp 2

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

Static Comp 2 gave me less trouble than Static Comp 1 thanks to Flexbox. I also spent much more time wireframing, so my code was easier to execute and I didn't end up backtracking and rewriting it as much. For this static comp I focused on recreating the comp exactly instead of taking design liberties. This helped train me to notice small details and figure out how to reproduce them exactly.

Evaluation comments: Icons are not as universally understood as one might think (apart from the hamburger icon). Make sure icons have descriptive text to go along with them. 

#### Static Comp 3

* https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge--3
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

Static Comp 3 was frustrating, but fun. I wireframed like crazy before ever getting started and just took the project on piece by piece. I used grid areas as my main organization tool and it worked flawlessly. It was very easy to alter in my media queries as well. I used flexbox in many of the individual sections for styling. I experimented more with hiding elements and unsetting others upon different page breaks. Overall, I was very pleased with the end result.

Evaluation comments: Great organization of CSS, nice naming conventions, very well executed, make sure to use Aria labels where appropriate, use <a> tags instead of divs when the element will link somewhere to avoid having to put cursor:pointer on everything.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/brandido/linked-lists
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Linked List challenged us to build a small application including two input fields. Upon entering data on the right side, it would be appended to the right side. We also had to inculde buttons for removing the appended elements and changing their style. Overall, my partner and I executed the project well. We worked well together, and made a strong effort to get a handle on Git/GitHub. 

**Evaluation comments:** 
Nice job on commits and commit messages
Keep on working on creating more branches each time you're working on a new feature/bug
Great job on UI
Try avoid using alerts in your next project when something should be disabled
Careful of spacing with mobile view
Good structure on HTML and use of ARIA
Good structure of CSS and clean code
Incorporate more grouping of CSS classes/etc.
Good structure of breaking out javascript from global variables, event listeners, and then function declarations
Really clean and refactored code.
Can continue to keep breaking out functions into smaller functions but in general, very good.
Experiment more using && or || operators especially when dealing with true/false inputs

**Evaluation scores:** 
Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

**Feedback to me:** "Casey was an absolute pleasure to work with.  I hope we get to do a project together in the future.  Her personality and skillset complimented my working style very well.  She also was really great at helping us with quality control and keeping at it. As we're all learning (which is why we came to this school) there are times of frustration when dealing with lots of new things (ie git/gitHub, all the assignments, etc.) and it can easily be overwhelming.  Casey does a good job of balancing that, I hope she can remember to keep positive and not be too hard on herself during these times of frustration.  She should know that if she stays at this, she'll be an exceptional developer and major contributor to any organization she chooses to be a part of."

#### Idea Box

* https://github.com/christopherchateau/ideabox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

This project built on the previous one. There were two input fields, a submit button and appended elements. There was more functionality as well. We were asked to imcorporate local storage and search/filter functionality. These new challenges pushed us, but Chris and I executed this project very well. We worked almost exclusively together and had fun with it. 

**Evaluation comments:** 
really well executed UI. a couple spots that could be polished for even better user experience, but they're minor details. Very tight execution and great attention to details.
one buggy layout issue on iphone 5
really clean HTML and css
no global variables
try out array prototypes instead of for loops!
in a great spot to refactor -- see if you can reduce duplication in your code
really solid project, super consistent quality level and attention to detail
GOOD JOB!

**Evaluation scores:** 
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

**Feedback to me:** "Casey is very easy to work with. She has a very calm demeanor and is eager to collaborate. She is especially adept with CSS and did a great job handling most of the the styling on the project. When arranging times to meet, she was very accommodating and had no issue scheduling around my unavailability on Saturday. I would recommend that Casey not hesitate to ask questions. There were a few times when she mentioned not following the javascript code. She preferred to revisit the code later to make sure she understood everything, which is great. But another step she could take here is to ask clarifying questions while pairing."

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* https://github.com/gmasterofnone/2DoBox-Pivot
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

(description)

**Evaluation comments:** 
Would like to have seen more commits, and more context provided
Use of aria labels to provide more context
Avoid comma seperated selectors, use a more broad class instead
Separate data model from markup - constructor could be task - it is not a card until its displayed on the page
Consider using bracket notation for refactoring

**Evaluation scores:** 
Proficient

**Feedback to me:** "Casey was a pleasure to work with. We were able to quickly establish a positive rapport, making the project a breeze.  Specifically, Casey's attention to detail make simple errors almost non-existent.  I find her to be and outstanding team mate and a very strong programmer. I think a standout quality of Casey's is her consistent drive for perfection. But in some cases, this could lead to a distraction in the details and an overall loss in focus on the project as a whole.  I would recommend some self reflection if she feels stuck on a specific issue to realize how that detail can be solved at a later time when minds are fresh."
