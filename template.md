# Casey Hoepner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Before coming to Turing I had almost no programming skills. During Mod 1 I set out to learn the foundational skills and knowledge required to start working towards a complete career shift into Software Development. One of the main reasons I chose to study at Turing as opposed to online learning was for community. I desired to be around others who were working toward a similar goal as me. I wanted to be able to ask questions as they come up and be able to aid others in their learning as well. Mod 1 has been all of this and more.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Static Comp 1

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-1
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html

We weren't too deep into the module yet, so I took this static comp as an opportunity to experiment with design. My biggest win was adding photos to the individual boxes on hover. This project also gave me an opportunity to learn CSS grid -- which I hadn't used before. 

Evaluation comments: Nice job adding opacity to the hover photos so that the overlayed text remains easy to read, but perhaps make it a bit more opaque next time. Don't forget your meta tag!

#### Static Comp 2

The objective of this project was to recreate a static comp using HTML and CSS.

* https://github.com/cah2858/ch-comp-challenge-2
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

Static Comp 2 gave me less trouble than Static Comp 1 thanks to Flexbox. I also spent much more time wireframing, so my code was easier to execute and I didn't end up backtracking and rewriting it as much. For this static comp I focused on recreating the comp exactly instead of taking design liberties. This helped train me to notice small details and figure out how to reproduce them exactly.

Evaluation comments: Icons are not as universally understood as one might think (apart from the hamburger icon). Make sure icons have descriptive text to go along with them.
